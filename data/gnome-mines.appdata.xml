   GNOME Mines is a puzzle game where you search for hidden mines. Flag the
   spaces with mines as quickly as possible to make the board a safer place. You
   win the game when you've flagged every mine on the board. Be careful not to
   trigger one, or the game is over!
  </p>
  <p>
   You can select the size of the field you want to play on at the start of the
   game. If you get stuck, you can ask for a hint: there's a time penalty, but
   that's better than hitting a mine!
